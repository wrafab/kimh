    <h3> Week 7 | CNC MILLING </h3>
    <br>
    <p>
The task for this week was 1) to design an original 2D design to use in the MDX40A, 2) to mill the parts using subtractive manufacturing using the MDX40A, and 3) to cast the part you milled.

1. This first image is a milled out part from the MDX40A. 
2. This shows the process of our class melting chocolate to put in our rubber molds!
3. The pink object on the left is the rubber mold created from the milled part, and one on the right shows the chocholate I created!

    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <br>
    <p>
When I first saw this grotesque looking machine, I was terrified. (I still do not recall why - but it looked like something I had seen from a horror movie). However, when I learned how this machine worked, I was intrigued. This machine used "subtractive manufacturing", which is: a process by which 3D objects are constructed by successively cutting material away from a solid block of material (creative mechanisms). As you might be able to notice, most of the facial features of the character is not shown. When I was working on printing this, since I wanted mine to print fast, I put my setting as less precision. Therefore, when I do this next time, I would increase the precision. Overall, I really enjoyed doing this project because I could create this cute mold to do anything with! When I get a chance, I am trying to create soap using this mold.    </p>
