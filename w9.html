    <h3>SOLDERING</h3>
    <br>
    <p>
When I stepped into the classroom, the smell that resembled burnt tire was lingering - and to be honest, I was not really excited about learning how to solder. It looked like a painstaking task, filling each hole using that tiny glue gun looking thing. To explain what soldering actually is, it is "Solder is any soft metal used to join two harder metals together via melting and fusing to the parts of the joint" (word reference).

This is the final version of my soldering pieces! YAY! Also, surprisingly, I really enjoyed soldering as it felt like a stress-reliever. From now on, I might be soldering when I am frustrated or stressed ...     </p>

    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <br>
    <p>
Although this experience did not start off pleasantly, I still managed to enjoy it a lot. Next time, I would want to create more boards by soldering!   </p>
