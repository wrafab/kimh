<H3> Week 2 | T-SHIRT/PHONECASE MAKING </h3>
<p> 
On week two, we created our own T-Shirts using a laser printer.

We first made the initial design for our t-shirt using Adobe Illustrator, and later used Abode photoshop to edit/enhance our design. Then, we uploaded our completed file to 'Corel Draw', in which we could adjust the size/dimensions of what our picture was going to appear like on our custom made t-shirt! |   MY DESIGNED T-SHIRT!

<H3>Reflection</h3>
<p>
When I was editing my image on photoshop, I was not aware of how "blurry" the circle would turn out to be on my t-shirt. Also, when I was editing my photo on Corel Draw, I was not well aware of the sizes of how the figure would turn out to be. Next time, since I now know how to make a T-shirt well (YAY!), I hope to create another one with a more complex/organized design in the future.
