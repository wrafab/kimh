    <h3> Week 2 | T-SHIRT/PRINT MAKING </h3>
    <br>
    <p>
      On week two, we created our own T-Shirts using the 'Brother GT-361 printer'.

    <h3>Project</h3>
    <br>
    <div class="container">
    	<img id="normalimg" src="shirt.png">
    	<img id="normalimg" src="shirt2.png">
      <img id="normalimg" src="tmachine.png">
      
    </div>
    <p>
      We first made the initial design for our t-shirt using Adobe Illustrator, and later used Abode photoshop to edit/enhance our design. Then, we uploaded our completed file to 'Corel Draw', in which we could adjust the size/dimensions of what our picture was going to appear like on our custom made t-shirt! |   After I finalized my design, I opened up PDIP 1.2 and adjusted where I wanted the image to print on the shirt.

    <h3>Using the UV Printer</h3>
    <br>
    <div class="container">
    	<img id="normalimg" src="ver1.png">
    	<img id="normalimg" src="ver2.png">
      <img id="normalimg" src="ver3.png">
    </div>
    <p>
     Using LEF-20 laser printing machine, I printed out my own drawing of my messy desk. I found this printer really confusing to use in the beginning, but soon learned to use it. I was satisfied with my product because it had the correct dimensions and color.

    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <br>
    <p>
      When I was editing my image on photoshop, I was not aware of how "blurry" the circle would turn out to be on my t-shirt. Also, when I was editing my photo on Corel Draw, I was not well aware of the sizes of how the figure would turn out to be. Next time, since I now know how to make a T-shirt well (YAY!), I hope to create another one with a more complex/organized design in the future.
