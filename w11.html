    <h3> Week 11| Candy Dispenser! </h3>
    <br>
    <p>
The task for this week was to create our final project using at least four different methods. Libby and I decided to create ... a CANDY DISPENSER! :)

    <h3>CANDY DISPENSER</h3>
    <br>
    <p>
After struggling to find what my final project would be, Libby and I came up with the idea of creating candy dispenser. Initially, we had no idea of how to make this, and even where to start. Therefore, we began to get some inspirations online by searching actual interior designs of candy dispensers. After a thorough research, we began to get a more solid idea of where our project would be headed. 
      
      
Our project's timeline was the following: 1) sketching on paper / thinking about dimensions 2) design on fusion 360 and print it in makerbot 3) print the tray using carboard box 4)create vinyl stickers (Christmas Decorations!) 
   
We used a LOOTT (sorry Mr. Gerber :P) of plastic material in the makerbot, used cardboard box, and some vinyl sheets for stickers. Libby and I spend a lot of time not only with coming up with this creative idea, but also in creating this. Furthermore, the process was not always easy. We encountered many incidents where things did not go as we thought it would, and often had to re-print objects several times. Libby and I were really satisfied with the way our project turned out - because it actually WORKED! We both sort of regretted that we could have made the designs more sturdier, but there is always next time!

* makerbot limitation: Convert .stl file to makerbot. The maximum dimensions are: 25.2 L x 19.9 W x 15.0 H cm, The minimum height (thickness) of a rectangle is 1.2 mm/minimum width: .45mm 
* cardboard box print: Make sure to adjust the power / speed to the appropriate level as it might cause the cardboard to burn, etc.

    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <br>
    <p>
When I first started this project, I was beyond intrigued and was plainly just excited to start creating it. However, during the process, I learned the importance of careful planning because having a proper plan would save you from repeating the same mistakes. While working on this project, I learned a lot about the designing process- not only how it can be rewarding, but how it requires a lot of thoughtful planning to begin with. This class, overall, has really taught me to think outside the box by providing me with new design/engineering experiences. When I get to do this project next time, I would take more time in carefully planning each dimensions!     </p>
