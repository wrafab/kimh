    <h3> Week 8 | ELECTRONICS PROJECT </h3>
    <br>
    <p>
This week's task was to create something interactive using either Chibitronics or Bare Conductive. Libby and I decided to create a light up galaxy painting that resembles the one that Mr. Gerber showed us in class.

    <h3>SCANNING</h3>
    <br>
    <p>
 While we were working on this, we were frustrated because the circuit did not work properly. However, after numerous efforts of changing spots, starting over, etc, we finally made the light to blink. After we finished with this lighting part, we painted the galaxy using sponge to put over it.

    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <br>
    <p>
The challenging part was figuring out where the stars were located and how to make the holes parallel with that of the circuit. Although it was frustrating at times, Libby and I were both really satisfied with how our project turned out. Next time, I would like to create a larger interactive painting that can sense human movement.   </p>
