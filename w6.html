      When we were given the wood pieces, we had to sand them in order to make the edges and the surfaces smooth. Then, we got a wet tissue and wiped down the surfaces. Personally, the hardest part for me was glueing the pieces together. They had to be glued as fast as possible because they would dry quickly. Another challenging part for me was to use the breather. When I saw other student easing through this process, I thought I would feel the same. However, I could barely move the pistons, so Mr. Gerber helped me vacuum it.

   It took a day or two for the wooden pieces to completely dry and get the shape of a longboard. I was really thrilled to see how mine turned out and I am excited to design it! I sanded my longboard in the woodshop to make the edges smoother.

    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <br>
    <p>
When I was working on glueing the wooden pieces together, since I put too much glue, some bumps appeared on my longboard. Therefore, to avoid these "bumps", I should have put more glue on the edges than on the center. Also, I did not get a chance to photograph my finished skateboard as I put it in my artroom drawer. After I spray painted (and hand painted) it black, I put characters from the painting I did during this marking period on my skateboard. MAKING SKATEBOARD WAS SO x âˆž FUN and I hope to make it again if I have a chance to!
