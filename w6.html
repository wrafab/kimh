    <h3> Week 6 | CNC Milling</h3>
    <br>
    <p>
      The task for the week was to create an enclosure for Raspberry Pi or Ardunio Uno using 360 Fusion design program.

      While I was sketching, I created vacant spaces (holes) in order for the air to ventilate through. Also, I wanted my enclosure to revolve horizontally (around the z-axis). Furthermore, the pillar-like structures served as a way to stabilize the lid. To move onto the procedure part, I firstly created a base with the right dimensions. I began to construct my figure, adding rectangular figures to the side, and pull/pushing the object. In the beginning, it was really challenging for me to figure out how to use this program. However, I soon was intrigued in the program, and found out many interesting features including: inspect, push/pull, modify, and more.  |  </i>

    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <br>
    <p>
      When I first started this project, I was struggling to figure out how to use the fusion 360 program. However, as I got used to the program, I soon loved using it. However, since it was my first time using this program, I had to look up some instructions online.
