    <h3> Week 4 | Design Rules and Limitations for Makerbot 5th Generation </h3>
    <br>
    <p>
1) Convert “.stl” file to “.makerbot”.
(Open the makerbot application where you can export the stl as makerbot file)
2) Make sure your figure has support to print. 
The maximum dimensions are: 25.2 L x 19.9 W x 15.0 H cm, The minimum height (thickness) of a rectangle is 1.2 mm/minimum width: .45mm
(Preview how large your mesh is going to be before you print!) 
3) Make sure you level the object to the platform level.

    <h3>SCANNING</h3>
    <br>
    <p>
   It was finally time for me to print out my arduino uno case. I was really nervous and excited at the same time because I did not know how it was going to turn out. 

   After experiencing several failures, I was devastated. (The “failed” Arduino cases are shown below). Therefore, I decided to change the design a bit and lay them separately on the ground instead of having them overlap each other.

    <div class="container">
    	<img id="normalimg" src="makerbot.png">
    	<img id="normalimg" src="au1.png">
    	<img id="normalimg" src="au2.png">
      
      
    </div>
    <p>
   It was not until I printed out my final case when I realized that the top part had a texture like the bottom part usually has. However, it was a good fit for the arduino uno, so I am satisfied with how it turned out!

    <h3>FAILED ARDUINO UNO CASES</h3>

   These are the pictures of FAILED my arduino uno case!

    </div>
    <p>
    When I printed out my arduino uno cases for the first few times, due to the lack of support on the object, it failed to print properly. I could not really figure out the reason why until I discovered that the two objects can not be overlapped on top of each other. Therefore, I decided to put each top and bottom on level ground separately. This helped the case to print out successfully!

 <h3>Additional 3D Objects</h3>
    <br>
    <p>
  
After thinking a long time about what I can possibly make as my 3D figure that “cannot be made subtractively”, I decided to make a small figure that is unique. This is the design of the pen holder I created for myself. 


I also created a teddy bear (from an online source).  I thought this white teddy bear was really cute when it was printed out. (Although I still feel like its feet fell off…)

 <h3>Making Myself</h3>
    <br>
    <p>
     
Mr. Gerber Knockout Concepts Mobile Scanner to scan me! When I saw others getting scanned, I thought it was kind of creepy, but when it was my turn to scan, it was not frightening at all. Instead, it was really interesting when I got my scanned self, because I could tell it was “me”. It felt like I had a twin sister or a clone of myself! This made me wish I had a clone robot who can perform tasks instead of me.

    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <br>
    <p>
      When I first started this project, I was struggling to figure out how to use the fusion 360 program. However, as I got used to the program, I soon loved using it. However, since it was my first time using this program, I had to look up some instructions online.
