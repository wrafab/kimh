    <h3> Week 1 | Computer-aided Design Assignment</h3>
    <br>
    <p>
    The task for this week was to create an enclosure for Arduino Uno using Fusion 360. Attached below are pictures and original files of my project. Also,     </p>

    <h3>Fusion 360</h3>
    <br>
    <p>
    "Sketch": I measured the dimensions of the arduino uno, and sketched them out on a piece of paper. I also thought about the characteristics of the arduino uno, and how I could make it better.

    "Procedure": These were the steps I took in order to create my arduino uno enclosure.

    "Sofa": This is one of the other projects that I have created using fusion 360.

      While I was sketching, I created vacant spaces (holes) in order for the air to ventilate through. Also, I wanted my enclosure to revolve horizontally (around the z-axis). Furthermore, the pillar-like structures served as a way to stabilize the lid. To move onto the procedure part, I firstly created a base with the right dimensions. I began to construct my figure, adding rectangular figures to the side, and pull/pushing the object. In the beginning, it was really challenging for me to figure out how to use this program. However, I soon was intrigued in the program, and found out many interesting features including: inspect, push/pull, modify, and more.  |  </i>

    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <br>
    <p>
Starting to use Autodesk Fusion 360 was overwhelming in the beginning as I was not sure of what to do exactly. Since it was my first time ever using a designing program like this, it took me a long time before I got to figure out how to "create" an object. However, as I started exploring more options and techniques, it was really intriguing. When I was working on this using my own laptop, due to the size of the program, it made my computer run really slow. I also used youtube guide tutorials of how to use Fusion 360 and to build Arduino Uno. I wish to create more complex objects using Fusion 360 in the future!

    Since the computers were reformatted in the makerspace, my sketchup file disappeared. Sorry!
