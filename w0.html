    <h3> Week 0 | Task </h3>
    <br>
    <p>
    The aim of this challenge is to build the tallest freestanding structure by ONLY using 20 sticks of spaghetti, one yard string, and one yard masking tape. The structure has to be free-standing without any supports, and the marshmallow has to be able to sit on top of the structure.

    <h3>Designing Process</h3>
    <br>
    <p>
    Our group thought it would be a good idea to start with a solid base. Therefore, we tried merging few spaghetti noodles together and forming a triangular base. However, since the base was too large compared to the figure, we had to rebuild the base into a smaller size. To add heights to the structure, we bent the noodles and morphed them into a pyramid shape.

    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <br>
    <p>
    Like many other groups, our group had a problem of stabilizing the tower. Although the base was strong enough to hold up the structure, the weight of the marshmallow made the structure collapse. After the challenge was over, our group thought it would have been better if we put more attention to building a more “stable” figure than a taller one. When we get a chance to do this again, I would definitely start off by building a strong base and making each layer more steadily.
