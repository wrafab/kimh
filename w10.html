    <h3> Week 10 |ARDUINO EXPERIMENTS</h3>
    <br>
    <p>
This week's task was to create six different arduino combinations.

    <h3>SCANNING</h3>
    <br>
    <p>
1-2) This project is blinking green LED: it blinks in turn. 
3) Blue LED: it turns on and off with the user-set time interval. 
4) transitor: it starts working when it is plugged to the computer 
5) sound: the arduino starts playing a song
6) temperature: arduino even detects temperature? What CAN'T the arduino do?!
7) Motor: the motor moves back and forth.

    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <br>
    <p>
When I first got the kit, I was overwhelmed. However, I got to learn more about the arduino and started having fun as Mr. Gerber and my classmates guided me throughout the process. I was really intrigued in knowing what the arduino could do, because it seemed like there was nothing impossible for it. When I get a chance next time, I would like to try out more arduino experiments!    </p>

    <h3>FILES</h3>
    <br>
    <ul>
    *** there are no specific files needed for this project - but check out the arduino website for instructions, etc *** 
     To write my own code, I changed the blinking time in the blinking LED from 1 second to 3 seconds by changing the time from 1000 to 3000. 
     By simply changing the numbers, we could change the blinking time however we wanted to.
