<H3> Week 3 | Computer Controlled Cutting</h3>
<p> 
This week, we learned various properties of vector and raster, and the importance of differentiating them. "Vector" was cutting through the object, and "Raster" was engraving.

<H3>Creating Boxes!</h3>
<p>
We created the plan for the figures using the program called 'Coral-Draw'. We made each of our own box unique by adding our own designs.

<i> After finishing outlining the box on Coral Draw, I exported my design to the flashdrive and went to the Laser Cutter. It first looked really intimidating because there were sparks forming inside the machine. However, I just decided to give it a try and hoped that nothing would explode. When my design started printing, however, due to the weak strength and the fast speed (I set the strength as 30 initially), the machine did not cut through boxes deep enough. Also, I was mindblown when Mr.Gerber told me that the holes on my dice could be penetrated.| Therefore, I changed my preferences a little. I upgraded the speed and the power level. This caused the box to cut much more faster with obviously stronger power, thanks to the help of Mr.Gerber.

<H3> Reflection </h3>
<p>
Although the process did not run smoothly, this was a very interesting and new experience for me as I got to create my own box. I learned that in order to make the box have penetrated parts, I should set each specific part as 'hairline'. Also, it is REALLY important to make sure all the settings in the preferences are set up properly.
